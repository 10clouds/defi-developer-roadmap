The Graph (GRT) is an Ethereum token that powers The Graph, a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying data from blockchains. Just as Google indexes the web, The Graph indexes blockchain data from networks like Ethereum and Filecoin. This data is grouped into open APIs called subgraphs that anyone can query.
