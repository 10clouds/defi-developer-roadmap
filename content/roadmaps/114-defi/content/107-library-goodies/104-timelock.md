A timelock is a smart contract that delays function calls of another smart contract after a predetermined amount of time has passed. Timelocks are mostly used in the context of governance to add a delay of administrative actions and are generally considered a strong indicator that a project is legitimate and demonstrates commitment to the project by project owners.
