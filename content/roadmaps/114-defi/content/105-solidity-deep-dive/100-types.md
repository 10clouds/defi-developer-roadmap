# Types

Solidity is statically typed, so the data type for each variable must be specified at compile time. The variables can only accept the data type for which they were designed by the developer and cannot be altered dynamically.

Solidity value types:

- Signed integers
- Unsigned integers
- Boolean
- Addresses
- Enums
- Bytes

Solidity reference types:

- Fixed-size arrays
- Dynamic-size arrays
- Array members
- Byte arrays
- String arrays
- Structs
- Mapping
