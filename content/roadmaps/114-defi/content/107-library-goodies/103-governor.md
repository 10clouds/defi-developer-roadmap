# Governor

The Governor Contract pattern is a commonly used open source smart contract that allows token holders to control a DAO with fully on-chain voting. 
The Governor Contract is responsible for managing DAO proposals. It keeps track of the status of proposals, and it counts the votes to see if they pass. If a proposal passes, the Governor executes the proposal on-chain.
