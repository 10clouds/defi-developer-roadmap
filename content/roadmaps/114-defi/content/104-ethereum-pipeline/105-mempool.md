# Mempool

In blockchain terminology, a mempool is a waiting area for the transactions that haven't been added to a block and are still unconfirmed. This is how a Blockchain node deals with transactions that have not yet been included in a block.

When an Ethereum node receives a transaction, it will propagate the transaction to peer nodes until a miner approves the transaction and adds it to a new block. Before itâ€™s added to the next block, the transaction remains in a staging/waiting area called mempool or txpool. It is also known as pending transactions.
