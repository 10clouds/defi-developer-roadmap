# EIP712

EIP 712 is a standard for hashing and signing of typed structured data. It is a more advanced and secure method of signing a transaction. Using this standard not only can a transaction be signed and that signature can be verified but data can be passed into the smart contract along with a signature and the signature can be verified against that data to know if the signer is the one who actually sent the data to be invoked in the transaction.
