# Primitives

##### State Mutability:

- view - used for reading from blockchain (i.e reading some variable from contract)
- pure - when we not read from blockchain (i.e compute addition)

##### Special Functions:

- receive - must be implemented in contract in order to allow receiving ether
- fallback - also allows receiving ether but also some arguments can be passed along to detetmine behaviour

##### Function Overloading:

> Contract can have multiple functions of the same name but with different parameter types.

##### Function Modifiers

> Function modifiers can be used to amend the semantics of functions in a declarative way (see Function Modifiers in the contracts section).

##### Events

> Events give an abstraction on top of the EVMâ€™s logging functionality. Applications can subscribe and listen to these events through the RPC interface of an Ethereum client

##### Errors and the Revert Statement

> Errors in Solidity provide a convenient and gas-efficient way to explain to the user why an operation failed. They can be defined inside and outside of contracts (including interfaces and libraries).
