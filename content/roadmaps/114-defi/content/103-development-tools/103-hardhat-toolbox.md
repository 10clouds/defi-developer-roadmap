# Hardhat Toolbox

The [hardhat-toolbox](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-toolbox) plugin bundles all the commonly used packages and Hardhat plugins we recommend to start developing with Hardhat.

When you use this plugin, you'll be able to:

- Deploy and interact with your contracts using ethers.js and the
  hardhat-ethers plugin.
- Test your contracts with Mocha, Chai and our own Hardhat Chai Matchers plugin.
- Interact with Hardhat Network with our Hardhat Network Helpers.
- Verify the source code of your contracts with the hardhat-etherscan plugin.
- Get metrics on the gas used by your contracts with the hardhat-gas-reporter plugin.
- Measure your tests coverage with solidity-coverage.
- And, if you are using TypeScript, get type bindings for your contracts with Typechain.
