# Health Factor

The health factor is an indicator calculated from the user's collateral balance (in ETH) multiplied by the current liquidation threshold for all the user's outstanding assets, divided by 100, divided by the user's borrow balance and fees (in ETH). This can tell how _healthy_ the loan is.
