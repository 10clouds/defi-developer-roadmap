The Uniswap protocol is a peer-to-peer1 system designed for exchanging cryptocurrencies (ERC-20 Tokens) on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol is implemented as a set of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts; designed to prioritize censorship resistance, security, self-custody, and to function without any trusted intermediaries who may selectively restrict access.

# Uniswap V3

Main features introduced in V2:

- liquidity for pairs can be provided between defined boundaries, this allows to more efficient usage of tokens inside pools
- user can provide liquidity in arbitrary pair values ex. 100 USDC and 0,1 ETH worth of 200 USDC
- when submitting liquidity user gets NFT token in exchange, not pool token like it was in previous uniswap versions
- variety of pool fees from 0,05% to 0,3%
