# AAVE

Aave is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized (perpetually) or undercollateralized (one-block liquidity) fashion.
Aave suports Ethereum, Ploygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Fantom, Harmony and Avalanche chains.
