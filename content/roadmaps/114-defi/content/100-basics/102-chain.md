Blocks are mined and added to the network, creating chain of blocks - blockchain.

Since protocol realys on democracy - majority vote - if someone could aquire control over the 51% of the network could start to manipulate the data and forge fradulent blocks before other miners.

Block conflict is the most common type of blockchain flaw, which indicates that if two blocks are published nearly simultaneously, a fork in the blockchain can occur, so it has been resolved by the Longest Chain Rule (LCR), i.e., if multiple blocks are present, treat the longest chain as valid. Because transactions on the wrong side of the fork would be restructured into new blocks, this rule causes a few transactions on the wrong side of the fork to be delayed, leading to blockchain reorganization.
