Metamask is a popular cryptocurrency wallet known for its ease of use, availability on both desktops and mobile devices, the ability to buy, send, and receive cryptocurrency from within the wallet, and collect non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It also supports multiple chains including testnets.

Additional handy [feature](https://github.com/metamask/eth-phishing-detect) is detecting phishing domains targeting Ethereum users. So when entering a new site metamask gives user a warning that it may be malicious.
