# Gnosis Safe

Gnosis Safe is a smart contract wallet running on Ethereum that requires a minimum number of people to approve a transaction before it can occur (M-of-N).

Gnosis Safes are commonly used to manage pooled DAO funds. DAOs often require a certain number of members to sign off on any fund transfers. DAO actions are generally voted upon by all members and then executed by the core group of signers.
