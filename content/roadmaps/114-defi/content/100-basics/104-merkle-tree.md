# Merkle Tree

Merkle trees, also known as Binary hash trees, are a prevalent sort of data structure in computer science. Merkle trees are used in distributed systems for efficient data verification. They are efficient because they use hashes instead of full files. Hashes are ways of encoding files that are much smaller than the actual file itself. Currently, their main uses are in peer-to-peer networks such as Bitcoin, Tor and Git.
