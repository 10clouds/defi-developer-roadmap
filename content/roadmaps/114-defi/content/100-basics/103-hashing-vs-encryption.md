# Hashing vs Encryption

Hashing and Encryption have different functions. Encryption is used to secure data from beeing read without private key. Encryption includes encryption and decryption process. In asymetrical standard,
encryption is performed using public key, but decryption is done using private key.

On the other hand, hashing is used to validate the authenticity and integrity of various types of input. Hashing is a one-way process that changes data into the message digest. This process is irreversible, it means that having particular hash we can not get the original input.
